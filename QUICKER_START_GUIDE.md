# Quick(er) Start Guide #

1. Download and install the MacFUSE package available under the "Downloads" tab of this project.

2. Download and try MacFUSE file systems such as SSHFS ([MACFUSE\_FS\_SSHFS](MACFUSE_FS_SSHFS.md)) from this web site. Many others are available from other developers.

3. Write your own MacFUSE file systems, or try numerous existing ones that were written for Linux FUSE. To compile such existing file systems, you may need additional software such as `glib` and `libintl`. To learn more about the details of MacFUSE development and advanced usage, please read the [HOWTO](HOWTO.md).
